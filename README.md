# Password Generator

## Description
A simple webpage made with CSS, HTML and JS that generates random strings of characters based on a set of user-specified criteria. 
In the future, it may be expanded to include options for full words and may be reworked with ReactJS to be a little more user friendly.

## Usage
The webpage is hosted with Github pages and can be accessed [here](https://jkohrt7.github.io/Password_Generator_webpage/). Clicking on 'generate password' will provide the user with 
additional options that customize the password to be generated, and pressing 'submit' will use these criteria to generate the password 
displayed in central text area.  

The application can only generate passwords between 8 and 128 characters.
